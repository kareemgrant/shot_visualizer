#ShotVisualizer

ShotVisualizer takes NBA shooting location data and provide users with a visual way to analyze a team's or individual's shooting performance from specific areas of the court. Visual shot location data has the power to reveal the 'hidden' statistics of the game that are not detailed in traditional box scores. ShotVisualizer has a variety of uses which include scouting, player development, player acquisition and research. 

The ShotVisualizerAPI lets anyone consume that valuable shot location data that NBA teams are increasingly using extract insights that influences their decisions. Now that information has been released (in limited fashion) to the general public.
