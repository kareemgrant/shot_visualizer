#ShotVisualizer

ShotVisualizer takes NBA shooting location data and provide users with a visual way to analyze a team's or individual's shooting performance from specific areas of the court. Visual shot location data has the power to reveal the 'hidden' statistics of the game that are not detailed in traditional box scores. ShotVisualizer has a variety of uses which include scouting, player development, player acquisition and research. 


ShotVisualizer represents a new era in Basketball Analytics. Think Moneyball for the hardwood!

### Technologies Implemented
* MongoDB
* D3.js
* And of course - Ruby on Rails

### Do you want to play with my data? Cool there's an API for that!
ShotVisualizer provides a super simple API for you to get all of that data we're using (until somebody tries to shut us down).

We're still working out the kinks, more details coming soon!
